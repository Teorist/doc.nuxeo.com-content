Once your assets are uploaded and/or created on your instance you will probably need to manage them, add some properties, tags, move them from one folder to another, archive them, validate them with your team, etc. Discover all the features available to help you manage and organize your media assets.

## Bulk Edit

The Nuxeo Spreadsheet add-on allows to bulk edit documents starting from a content view result set, providing a spreadsheet-like user experience.

This add-on allows you to edit data in your repository as if you were in a spreadsheet-like grid, like copy and paste by dragging the cell's value.

![]({{file name='spreadsheet-view.png' page='nuxeo-spreadsheet'}} ?w=450,border=true)

Read the [Nuxeo Spreadsheet documentation]({{page version='' space='nxdoc' page='nuxeo-spreadsheet'}}) for more information.

## Versioning

The Nuxeo Repository includes a versioning system. At any time, you can ask the repository to create and archive a version of a document. Versioning can be done automatically, according to some versioning policies, or on-demand, through the UI.

Document versions enable you and other users to easily revert to a specific version of the document if needed, without having to edit the document. The Nuxeo Platform offers both automatic and manual versioning of documents.

Each version has:
- A label
- A major version number
- A minor version number

The versioning service is configurable so you can define the numbering policy.

For more information about the versioning system of Nuxeo Platform, read the [Versioning documentation]({{page version='' space='nxdoc' page='versioning'}}).

## Archive Assets
