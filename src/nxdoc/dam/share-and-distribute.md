## Collections

A collection can be shared with other users, it means [giving permissions]({{page page='managing-permissions'}}) to specific users on the collection. Collections created in the default domain in a shared workspace or folder are automatically shared to all the workspace or folder's users, following the [rights inheritance principle]({{page page='managing-permissions#rights-inheritance'}}).

Collections created in your personal workspace are private by default. You must grant the needed permissions on the collection if you want to share it. Granting permissions to a collection makes the collection available to users from their Home. The list of documents displayed inside the collection depends on the permissions of the user on each of the documents.

##  Renditions

Renditions are alternative representations of a document, or its content such as:

*   A PDF representation of office files
*   A watermarked image
*   A resized video
*   An XML export of the document
*   ...

In the Nuxeo Platform, renditions are used for exports. Users can export documents on their computer one at a time or an entire workspace, folder or section.

Read the [Exporting Documents]({{page version='' space='userdoc' page='exporting-documents'}}) page for more information.
